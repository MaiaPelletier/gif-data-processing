Notes:
*Technically, Ind 10.7.2 will be picked up by code alterations, however it doesn't pick up the proper definition since this section has 100000 paragraphs :(
** Might need to add the extra paragraph of the definition - might need to alter code to pick up all text (definition_position + 1 AND concept_position - 1)
***Code should have already picked up 12.3.1 so need to re-run and check
****Might need manual input (same as **)
*****Same as ***
